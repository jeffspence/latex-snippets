## Truncating author lists
Problem:
Papers with many authors can take up multiple pages in the bibliography.
See the examples in author_trunc/

Solution:
Truncate the author list and then put "et al." at the end, by
downloading the .bst file of interest and swap out the format.name
function for the one in author_trunc/author_trunc.txt
